# Westwood Community Garden

## Introduction
Welcome to our project submission for Hoth XI! Our project embodies the concept of environmental intersectionalism by serving as a website designed to manage and promote a local community garden in Westwood, Los Angeles. Community gardens play a crucial role in addressing food insecurity in disadvantaged communities while promoting sustainability through organic, small-scale practices.

## Features

- **Worker Profiles**: Profiles of volunteers and the garden manager, hyperlinked to their respective social media profiles for easy access.
- **Crops Selection**: Displays a variety of crops grown in the garden, each with its own countdown timer to the next harvest. Clicking on a crop links to its Wikipedia page for more information.
- **Garden Layout**: Provides a visual map of the garden layout, allowing visitors to click on specific crop locations to navigate directly to the corresponding crop page.
- **Volunteer Schedule**: Organizes volunteer shifts for easy scheduling, enhancing coordination and management within the community garden.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: Used for structuring the website's content and layout.
- **CSS**: Stylesheets applied to enhance visual presentation and design.
- **JavaScript**: Implemented for interactive features such as the harvest countdown timer
- **Google Calendar Integration**: Links the website's volunteer schedule to a Google Calendar, providing real-time updates and event details.

## Noteworthy Features
- **Custom Artwork**: All artwork except the homepage image, including graphics, infographics, profile pictures, and crop images, is custom-made for the project.
- **Interactive Map Linking**: The garden layout map allows users to click on specific crop locations to navigate directly to detailed crop information.
